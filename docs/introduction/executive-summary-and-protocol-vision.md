# Executive Summary & Protocol Vision

**BitLoan** is a streamlined, Ethereum-based collateralized lending protocol designed to make decentralized borrowing simple, efficient, and transparent. It enables users to deposit **ETH as collateral** and borrow **ERC20 assets** (such as cNGN) through a single, unified lending market. The protocol focuses on clarity, predictable behavior, and verifiable safety—avoiding unnecessary complexity while delivering the core value users expect from a modern on-chain credit market.

Where established protocols like **Aave**, **Compound**, and **Morpho** support large multi-market ecosystems with dozens of asset pairs, BitLoan intentionally takes the opposite approach: **one collateral asset, one borrowable asset, one borrow position per user**. This minimalistic design provides stronger security guarantees, eliminates cross-market contagion risks, and ensures more transparent liquidations. The architecture is optimized around three principles: predictable economics, low protocol surface area, and uncompromising risk management.

At its core, BitLoan is built for users who want to borrow stable-value assets against volatile collateral without the overhead of navigating multi-pool systems. Borrowers get clear borrowing power, transparent health factors, and mathematically deterministic behavior. Suppliers earn interest driven by a simple utilization-based model, with no hidden incentives or opaque mechanics. Liquidators operate within a fair, rules-based environment that prevents over-liquidation and rewards fast, accurate execution.

Long-term, the vision for BitLoan is to become the **canonical ETH-backed borrowing primitive** for localized stablecoins, emerging on-chain currencies, and ecosystem-specific assets—especially in markets underserved by traditional DeFi systems. By remaining simple at the base layer, BitLoan can support more advanced products on top: leveraged staking, synthetic assets, cross-chain collateralization, and programmable credit modules. The protocol is designed to be an extensible foundation that developers can integrate directly into dApps, payment flows, and on-chain financial rails.

BitLoan aims to provide borrowers, lenders, liquidators, and integrators with a credit market that is easy to understand, auditable by design, and safe to use. The mission is to build a lending protocol that trades complexity for reliability and positions itself as the most transparent ETH-collateralized borrowing system available in decentralized finance today.
